# Triaging

This document describes the triage process for issues and pull requests in this repository.

## Triage Meetings

Maintainers regularly review new issues and pull requests to:

1. **Validate** - Confirm the issue is valid and contains sufficient information
2. **Categorize** - Apply appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
3. **Prioritize** - Determine urgency and importance
4. **Assign** - Optionally assign to a maintainer or contributor

## Labels

Common labels used in this repository:

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `bug` | Something isn't working |
| `enhancement` | New feature or request |
| `documentation` | Improvements or additions to documentation |
| `good first issue` | Good for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | Extra attention is needed |
| `untriaged` | New issue awaiting triage |

## Process

1. New issues receive the `untriaged` label automatically
2. Maintainers review during triage meetings
3. Valid issues are labeled and prioritized
4. Invalid or duplicate issues are closed with explanation

## Getting Involved

Community members are welcome to participate in triage by:

- Providing additional context on issues
- Suggesting labels or priorities
- Offering to work on issues
